Explanation:
The set command sets a variable to a value.
set /p asks for user's input
p is for prompt
set /a deals with math
a is for arithmetic

Usage:
@echo off
        ::Stop displaying commands.
set year=2016
        ::Variable year is 2016.
        ::This is set in the program.
set /p name=Please enter your name: 
        ::Ask the user for their name.
        ::Note that the user, not the program, sets what value name is.
set /p age=How old are you? 
        ::Ask the user for their age.
        ::Same thing here.
:inthirtyyears
        ::This is a label.
        ::In this case, it is only a "comment".
set /a year+=30
        ::Set year equal to its old value (2016) plus the value 30. (2046)
        ::Note that this is set in the program.
cls
        ::Clear the screen
set /a newage=age+30
        ::Set newage equal to the value of age plus the value 30
        ::Same thing here.
echo/In 30 years, you (%name%) will be %newage% years old. %year%
        ::Echos "In 30 years, you (user's name) will be (user's age + 30) years old. 2046"
        ::Note that echo has a / after it. This is acceptable.
<nul set /p=Isn't that cool? &>nul pause
        ::Two commands in one line:
        ::<nul set /p=Isn't that cool? 
        ::Prints "Isn't that cool? " without asking for user input. Done to not go to new line.
        ::>nul pause
        ::Pauses without printing "Press any key to continue . . ."
